title: Batman vs Superman voting app updated
---

## Update
There was a previous post about my demo site Batman vs Superman. It's a simple voting application, what I created for a Google IO Extended
demonstration.

It was made with AngularJS 2 back in March, but the API changed a lot (really lot) since then so I started to update my demo too. Meanwhile I've got some ideas too to improve the main features a little bit. I'm planning to create a step-by-step tutorial
that will describe how to build this application on your own.

I also have other project ideas which are currently under development. I will post about them as soon as they reach a beta version.

Until then checkout the actual state of the Batman vs Superman site:
