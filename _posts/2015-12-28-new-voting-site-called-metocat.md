title: MetoCat.com finally started!

### Meto... whaaaat?
As the title tells you, we finally started our side project called MetoCat (nothing special in the name, we were just out of our creative
pills sorry... ).

So, what is this side project? Basically it's the abstraction of the Batman vs Superman (BVS) application I created a few months ago.
We wanted to build something simple, that can be scaled easily later, so the BVS app was the best starting point to do that.

### Just another voting app, really?
In MetoCat you can create similar voting forms, it's a dynamic version of BVS, but we are planning to build much more features because it's really awesome to work on your idea in your free time, especially with AngularJS (even if your idea is a small thing). Yeah, MetoCat is built in AngularJS (1.4).

### What features?
So what feaures does MetoCat have right now? It's not a world-saving application (yet), so don't wait for that cool stuffs... but you can do the following things in it:

* Login with Twitter or Reddit (wait for so much more to come...)
* Create voting forms (You can upload image to it, select multiple opponents, tags, you can create it as anonim)
* Vote forms (even as anonim), see results (simple realtime statistics)
* Embed any form in your website

How embed looks like, you can checkout the BVS app:

I hope you like the initiative. There will be more updates and features, just wait for it!
