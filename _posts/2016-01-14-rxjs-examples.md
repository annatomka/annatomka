title: RxJS examples

Last weekend I started to learn RxJS. It's a pretty cool library, so be sure to have a look on it. 

I also created some smaller examples and I'm planning to write some explaining to them later. 
If you are interested, you can check them out. Right now there are only three examples, but I'll add more.

If you'd like to learn RxJS, I hardly recommend these resources: 
[rx-book](https://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/)
[ReactiveX website](http://reactivex.io)
